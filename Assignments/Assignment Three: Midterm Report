For information on my Midterm Report, read the Week Four log in the markdown file.

For images of my progress with the OADTL using WorldCat's system and developing my first collection "DTL OA Universidad Complutense Madrid Dissertations",
view the images under "Assignments" that I was unable to paste here, titled "UCM backend image.PNG",
and "DTL OA Universidad Complutense Madrid Dissertations_Lily's Collection.PNG". 

The first image is a closeup of the entry of one of my twelve titles, and the second is an overview
of my entire collection so far. By the end of the quarter, I hope to bring it as far as 100 titles!

Thank you for reading.
