As with the Midterm Report, the Supervisor's Final Evaluation is a private Google Forms document which is (for me) submitted by Ann Hidalgo to Helene Williams for her review. 

Although I did not see the contents of this survey, I know that Ann has been supportive and kind of my efforts with the Digital Theological Library, and I am optimistic about my success.

Thank you for reading.
