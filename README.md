**Week One Reflections and Summary: Dated 06/26/2023**

***The following log documents my journey through the UW iSchool's course LIS 590A: Directed Fieldwork, instructed by Helene Williams. This course requires students to find a host site (person or organization) willing to provide training in exchange for student contribution towards larger projects or goals. In my own case, I have connected with Drs. Tom Phillips and Ann Hidalgo of the Open Access Digital Theological Library. This summer, I will create and publish digital collections in the DTL using the Online Computer Library Center. More than anything, I am looking forward to creating something tangible that I could show to future employers as evidence of competency and vested interest in digital curation, as I anticipate a career in similar fields. My experience with computer technology is slightly more limited than my peers, so this internship should also help to mend any gaps in my knowledge of back-end website maintenance.***

***My first week of Summer Quarter 2023 was somewhat less eventful than I had expected, something which did cause me a little anxiety, because I have some small doubts that I will not be able to perform the tasks required of me. The site supervisor with whom I had an email conversation, Tom, was absent on vacation and I was in the dark for much of the week. However, I contacted another member of my course, Victoria, and she gave me the email contact of Ann Hidalgo. This morning (6/26/2023) at 9:30 PST, Ann met with Victoria and me over Zoom to teach us the ropes of the OCLC, and how to select and transfer titles from OCLC to the DTL.***

***We began with Ann making an account for each of us through the OCLC and using them to enter the website’s “metadata” tab. Then, Ann continued by searching the OCLC for “free to read” titles, deselecting all “selected titles” and choosing a keyword for which to narrow the results. Each result has an Internet Archive link reading “website” next to it in the OCLC search results, but each selected result must be tested to prove that the link is not expired. By checking that chosen titles’ names and dates matched between the Internet Archive web posting and the OCLC/WorldCat search result, Ann showed us we could prove that a source is authentic and usable. Finally, Ann taught Victoria and me to use the provided OCLC number identifier to search for and open a record in the Digital Theological Library catalog, and select the DTL’s “my library” check box in order to secure the title within their database.***

***After the Zoom call, Ann suggested that our next week’s step would be choosing a topic we may use to thematically frame or center our products. There’s a slight trade-off between granularity and relevance, as broader topics have more results and greater breadth of subject than the finer topics. I have yet to choose my topic, but many possibilities are bouncing in my mind. Next week’s log should have my decisions fixed, which is exciting.***

***This week, I have been at times nervous, relaxed, left in silence, and overwhelmed with knowledge. As my progress plan stabilizes over the next few weeks, there will be less excitement but clearer vision and a greater sense of accomplishment. I can feel that good things are coming, and this GitHub page will continue to develop alongside my knowledge and experience in digital curation.***

**Week Two Reflections and Summary: Dated 07/03/2023**

***This will be a short post, mainly because my second week has been calm and free of turbulence. After learning the steps that Ann showed to me in the Zoom meeting mentioned in last week's diary, I set off adding solo records to the Digital Theological Library using WorldCat's OCLC numbers and comparing selected texts to their counterparts in the Internet Archive's free-to-read e-book section. On Friday following the Fourth of July, Victoria and I met with Ann one more time to hammer out our techinical errors and gain more experience with the OADTL and WorldCat's Metadata profile.***

***From there, I searched for singular records in the area of religious studies, cross-referenced their details and added them into the OADTL's collections. Of course, I noticed pretty quickly that many of the common themes of religious studies had already been etensively picked through and added. That left either veering into obscure topics, or adding titles with questionable relevance. After struggling for a while, I found that terms like "date palm", "pogroms", and "metallurgy" yielded results I was happy to add to the collection. My thinking about religious studies and the way it draws together seemingly disparate and irreconcilable discipines has deepened my respect for the field. My persistence with the DTL's system from the back-end has increased my comfort with the process. Ann says that this is an important step before progressing to creating and managing thematic collections, or pulling records in from other repositories around the world.***

***At this point in the quarter, my fears of technological inadequacy are quelled by a familiarity with the system. However, the question of what my personal collections will be centered around remains. With a focus on the iSchool's values of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, I am hoping to involve Disability Studies where possible. It's up to me to begin research into which avenues of DS I plan to incorporate with religious studies, and what kinds of keywords will bring me the results I desire.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Week Three Reflections and Summary: Dated 07/10/2023**

***This morning at 9:30am over Zoom, Ann met virtually from the East Coast with our little OADTL intern team in Washington (Victoria Rincon and myself) to begin instruction on publishing unique and personalized collections in the DTL wesbite from the back-end. This differs from our previous work of adding singular titles, and allows for our efforts to be recognized and centrered around a theme or concept. Of course, everything still needs to be focused on religious studies, but the brush we paint with may be broad, as it's hard to say which titles will be relevant to whom in the future. At the moment, we are working with dedicated external libraries to pull titles that are not present in the DTL, yet have an OCLC number, and add them to the OADTL in a specific area using the Collection Manager on WorldCat. I couldn't be more excited to take the first steps in publishing a real online library!***

***From the beginning, Ann emphasized that what the DTL needs is biligual researchers who can expand their language base. Speaking Swedish and Spanish myself, Ann created a collection for me to begin fleshing out which relates to the UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico) Repositorio Institucional, focused solely on their open access theses and dissertations of religious studies. It's easier for her to create the collections at this time, she says, as there are several settings to deactivate such as MARC Record Delivery. So at this time, I can't choose the area of my study as carefully, but I am experiencing a trial run in publishing collections to which I can add my name in the "Collection Note" section.***

***My biggest concern moving away from this meeting, and heading into this new process of adding titles (creating titles using OCLC numbers to pre-fill information), is the lack of OCLC numbers attached to UNAM's records. I search for what feels like ages, and the content is right on target for what I want to select, but the records which are connectable to the OADTL through WorldCat using the OCLC number system are frustratingly few and far between. Perhaps there's something about my keyword searching which is just too broad, but I was unable to find a single record in UNAM's Institutional Repository which was trasnferrable to the DTL in half an hour. Ann told me to email her the following evening if I was still stuck, and that I just may do...***

***On the whole, things are ramping up in a way that I'm comfortable with, but excited for. There's always that interim aproaching the next step where everything feels so much more permanent and serious than it truly is, and that fear can be a little paralyzing. But, I remind myself that experience takes time, and both will make me feel more adjusted with exposure to the DTL's computer system. I am grateful for the experience I am permitted through this internship and can't wait to begin adding my own touches.***

**Week Four Reflections and Summary: Dated 07/18/2023**

***Instead of posting on a Monday as per usual, I have waited until Tuesday evening to update my log. After a bout of food poisoning which disturbed my normal routine, I was given another opportunity to meet Ann directly over Zoom and hash out our collaborative midterm survey. Apart from updating this GitHub blog (though I have been weekly), we carefully considered my progress as an intern and how true the work I have accomplished has been to the deadlines we determined at the outset of the program. Ann was stunningly gracious in her review, and that kindness made me feel as if my hours with the OADTL have counted for something much greater than just three university credits. Of course, it feels good to have my name on something, but the conversations we've had as semi-colleagues and now friends feel empowering and enrich my experience with this Directed Fieldwork course so much more.***

***As far as my first collection goes, UNAM was a bust. There simply weren't enough records with OCLC numbers for me to assemble a collection, and I emailed Ann last Wednesday in an absolute snit about it. Still wanting to work in my second language, she quickly found three other Spanish-spoken repositories which use WorldCat: LA Referencia from Latin America, Universidad Complutense de Madrid from...Spain...and another from Brazil, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul Porto Alegre. My top choice was the UCM repository, because in my opinion it was the most navigable and pleasant to browse. From there, Ann did some back-end technical magic (which I have yet to learn in the following weeks) and set up my first collection on the OADTL: "DTL OA Universidad Complutense Madrid Dissertations"!***

***Working with UCM has been a breeze compared to the endless searching, sifting, comparing, and dissapointment of UNAM's OCLC-incompatible base. In the area of religious studies, there are an endless number of options to choose from. Although I had previously stated (and intend) to work in the area of Disability Studies, I have centred my first collection around the intersections of feminism, gender studies, and world religion. So far, I have twelve titles that are ready to go, and may be accessed by any learner with an Internet connection and some free time.***

***Take a look! This image is also available in Assignment Three, but keep in mind that Assignment One and Assignment Two are still blank placeholders, as those were submitted over Canvas.***

***It feels wonderful to know that I have such supportive people around me as Victoria and Ann, both of whom I feel are there to help me succeed. By the end of the quarter, I want to develop my first collection to over one hundred titles. Of course, I am vetting their relevancy, but it would be lovely to see my hard work grow into something that could be instrumental in another person's homework or even their thesis. This course, LIS 590 A: Directed Fieldwork, is something that I would reccomend to anyone who loves hands-on work, but also appreciates the training wheels process. For myself, I truly felt I was awful with computers, but on my midterm survey Ann went out of her way to comment on my proficiency. It's clear from that alone, and also from my first collection being such a success, that I'm growing and thriving under the supervision of the iSchool and the DTL.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Five Reflections and Summary: Dated 07/25/2023**

***This is my first experience with a major snag in the process of building a digital collection. Last week, while on Zoom with Ann, I discovered that the titles have pulled from Universidad Complutense Madrid's online repository are not dissertations which stem from the institution itself. After all the work of formatting and selecting titles, as well as going back in and replacing their Title URLs, I found that I have been doing my collocation entirely wrong. It was quite devastating at first to accept, but thankfully my collection was still small. Fortunately, Ann walked me through the process once more, and I feel an increased sense of confidence in my ability to work with WorldSearch and the OCLC system of identifiers in order to produce a collection for the DTL.***

***Do forgive my short post. This week has been challenging for a number of personal reasons, and I have to keep reminding myself that any lost hours can be made up at other points during the quarter. Still, it's a little hard to see myself producing the numerous and massive collections which I had imagined at the outset. I'm not going to let those thoughts interfere with my effort or progress, however. No matter where I land, I feel comfortable with the amount which I have learned, and its ability to help me launch my career in the future. Perhaps even my capstone could work in some of the religious themes that I have become used to browsing material for the DTL's platform.***

***Here's hoping that with time, and a little elbow grease, my concerns will resolve as I gain more experience and comfort with online library systems. One major part of the issue is their diverse advanced search capabilities, but the more I see the more I know, and that's comforting in a way. Check back in soon!***

**Week Six Reflections and Summary: Dated 7/31/2023**

***Hello again. This week, I’m feeling better, and I’m working about the same as ever. That’s good***

***As I look back on the excitement I carried in previous weeks, I keep reminding myself how important it is to recognize the nonlinear path my progress and growth have been in LIS 590: Directed Fieldwork. That’s something my supervisor Ann has been absolutely instrumental in providing during this week’s meeting. Although we met at the standard scheduled time, Monday at 9:30, Victoria wasn’t there. At first, I was nervous to be in the spotlight, and have my frustrations with the OCLC/WorldShare system and my perceived lack of progress be unmasked—but I also used the opportunity to share with Ann how worried I am about not living up to my own expectations for the program so far.***

***In all this time with the DTL, I’ve added titles individually. Then, a collection was created for me to work with UNAM. That failed due to a lack of available content. So, a collection was created for me to work with UCM. That failed because I wasn’t adding doctoral theses directly. Finally, I’ve deleted my collection with UCM and made a second, identical collection to which I’ve added 11 titles correctly. Just eleven. The end of the quarter is approaching and I feel like these potholes in my success come down to me alone.***

***On the one hand, it’s very easy to compare myself to Victoria, and feel ashamed that I have fewer titles than her, with none in my own personal thematic collection (as I had aspired to for weeks). Immediately, Ann pointed out that I’m on a different trajectory from her entirely. Not only am I working in Spanish, but I’m also pulling titles from university libraries’ doctoral theses sections. It’s apples and oranges. To me, that acknowledgement was a relief.***

***To Ann, even if I don’t produce thousands of new titles in multiple collections, I have been a success insofar as I know how to navigate the DTL system, use WorldShare’s platform and hunt for titles that are relevant and open access to readers. For the last two weeks of the course, she suggested that I concentrate on my Universidad Complutense de Madrid collection and flesh it out, but not get bogged down by my dreams of thematic collections. To the DTL, university collections are important and helpful, and I’d rather do one thing right than many things halfway.***

***To me, that means the world. I take these skills away with me, not the collection itself. I am so grateful for Ann’s guidance, and I know it will carry me far now that I’m competent in creating, populating, and troubleshooting online collections—the exact thing I agreed to learn to do when I signed up for this course. Not thousands of titles. Four skills.***

***All in all, my progress feels good. Ann spent the rest of the meeting teaching me about MARC record delivery, and how to find the most recent "DTL OA" (Digital Theological Library Open Access) collections which our interns are producing. I'm happier now with where I am and what I have.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week Seven Reflections and Summary: Dated 08/07/2023**

***Back again with some pleasant updates. I’m up to fifty-two titles and increasing all the time! There was a frustrating moment today where I tried to work on my collection and UCM’s server was down the whole day, but that’s alright. I’ve emailed Ann about creating another collection to work on inbetween populating my UCM collection—I think it’s a good idea. We'll see what she says, as the days drag on and the final evaluation is so soon.***

***Our little team met this Monday for the penultimate hangout over Zoom. It’s been a while since I saw Victoria’s face, and it’s scary knowing I’m only meeting Ann one more time after this meeting. Thankfully, Victoria and I will stay friends over a messaging platform. We have much in common.***

***That morning, Ann taught us to work with .KBART sheets, which are .XSLS compatible files that contain all the information needed to import many titles into a digital library at once. You download, check for errors, change an autofill function, and upload. Easy as that, but it often goes awry due to little errors. My first attempt was a success, and I imported five titles into a tiny collection called "Lily Training" which I'll delete after I leave the DTL. Knowing how to use the .KBART sheets is a highly useful skill for our futures, me in particular because I’m interested in public librarianship more and more as the weeks go by.***

***We’re down to the final crunch, and it’s up to me to make sure that my collection is full. The DTL has one other collection from UCM with 380 titles…not sure I’ll ever get that far, but Ann says it’s irrelevant as many of my titles are likely new. No matter what happens, I will do my best, and I hope my loyal reader enjoys the final products of my eventful summer. I’ll keep you posted!***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Week Eight (Actually, Week 10!) Reflections and Summary: Dated 08/14/2023**

***Hello, loyal reader. I have made much progress since my last entry, and now I own three collections, for a total of 100+ titles! Each collection is complete and comprehensive—meaning that at the date of writing this, every single thesis or dissertation in religious studies or adjacent material released by each university is included in the collection. Here are their names (found below) and they feature my name and contact information in their "Collection Notes" as well! For each collection, I submitted a request to promote it to the Global Cooperative, but none have been approved yet. Until then, I cannot post links, but there are images in my Assignment Five folder where you can view the contents of the collections, and they will be searchable through "thedtl.org".***

***DTL OA Universidad Complutense Madrid Dissertations in Religious Studies (65 titles): (link pending per acceptance of collection to Global Cooperative)***
***DTL OA UC Santa Cruz Dissertations in Religious Studies (23 titles): (link pending per acceptance of collection to Global Cooperative)***
***DTL OA UC Merced Dissertations in Religious Studies (22 titles): (link pending per acceptance of collection to Global Cooperative)***

***As you can see, two of these collections are not from UCM. After running out of titles to add there, I bounced between several Latin American university libraries, and all came up dry. The largest issue was a lack of OCLC numbers through which I could add the titles. So, after a panicked email to Ann, I used the University of California’s eScholarship platform and pulled every title in religious studies from their Santa Cruz and Merced campuses. While it was a quick turnaround time, I am happy to announce that everything is complete.***

***By the way, what the title of this entry says is true. Between nailing down the details of this Directed Fieldwork, not hearing back from Tom as he was on safari, and making contact with Ann Hidalgo, I began my training with WorldCat two weeks into the quarter. So while I’m in the final week of LIS 590, dubbed Week 10, it is actually only my eighth week of working for the DTL.***

***Even so, I’m happy to say I made twenty hours a week, every week. It was not a linear progression, as my increase in skills and knowledge (from adding individual titles, to populating pre-made collections, to creating and publishing my own collections) was exponential. Much of my time was spent anxious and frozen when troubleshooting was required, but Ann was always there for me in a heartbeat, day or night. And, when I think back on my learning outcomes, I am reminded that my own expectations for the course (adding hundreds if not thousands of titles, creating disability studies themed collections) were formed in a lack of knowledge of what I would accomplish. Ann has reminded me that it’s highly useful to the DTL that I ended up creating university-themed collections, particularly in Spanish language. For specifics on my satisfactory progress, please refer to the Learning Outcome Agreement I signed (AKA Assignment One in this respository), which I will paste below, for some insight into what I was tasked to achieve.***

***From the start of week two, I was already able to “activate titles within existing OCLC collections”, and by week three, I was starting to “create digital collections in the OCLC knowledge base” with Ann’s help. When things went awry with UNAM, as with many of the other universities I proposed building collections for, I mastered the ability to “troubleshoot discoverability and access problems in the OCLC environment.” That right there was what consumed the bulk of my time with the DTL. I feel that put together, this process demonstrates an effort towards diversity (of information content), equity (of information access), and inclusion (working in a foreign language to bring Spanish titles to the Digital Theological Library) which the UW seeks to promote by offering LIS 590.***

***To me, this Directed Fieldwork was a total success, and I’m in the progress of being accepted to another site for the Fall Quarter which lies ahead. My experience and comfort with online library systems is greatly enhanced, and my ability to compete in the world of Information Science is equally supplemented by this experience. Plus, I walk away with three university credits and my efforts go towards helping a lovely organization who work hard to expand the access of academic material. It’s a lovely ending to a lovely experience, and I couldn’t be more grateful. Once my collections go global, I will return here to add links to my collections listed above.***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Thank you reader, for staying with me. We have reached our end...for now.***
