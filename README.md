**Week One Reflections and Summary: Dated 06/26/2023**

***The following log documents my journey through the UW iSchool's course LIS 590A: Directed Fieldwork, instructed by Helene Williams. This course requires students to find a host site (person or organization) willing to provide training in exchange for student contribution towards larger projects or goals. In my own case, I have connected with Drs. Tom Phillips and Ann Hidalgo of the Open Access Digital Theological Library. This summer, I will create and publish digital collections in the DTL using the Online Computer Library Center. More than anything, I am looking forward to creating something tangible that I could show to future employers as evidence of competency and vested interest in digital curation, as I anticipate a career in similar fields. My experience with computer technology is slightly more limited than my peers, so this internship should also help to mend any gaps in my knowledge of back-end website maintenance.***

***My first week of Summer Quarter 2023 was somewhat less eventful than I had expected, something which did cause me a little anxiety, because I have some small doubts that I will not be able to perform the tasks required of me. The site supervisor with whom I had an email conversation, Tom, was absent on vacation and I was in the dark for much of the week. However, I contacted another member of my course, Victoria, and she gave me the email contact of Ann Hidalgo. This morning (6/26/2023) at 9:30 PST, Ann met with Victoria and me over Zoom to teach us the ropes of the OCLC, and how to select and transfer titles from OCLC to the DTL.***

***We began with Ann making an account for each of us through the OCLC and using them to enter the website’s “metadata” tab. Then, Ann continued by searching the OCLC for “free to read” titles, deselecting all “selected titles” and choosing a keyword for which to narrow the results. Each result has an Internet Archive link reading “website” next to it in the OCLC search results, but each selected result must be tested to prove that the link is not expired. By checking that chosen titles’ names and dates matched between the Internet Archive web posting and the OCLC/WorldCat search result, Ann showed us we could prove that a source is authentic and usable. Finally, Ann taught Victoria and me to use the provided OCLC number identifier to search for and open a record in the Digital Theological Library catalog, and select the DTL’s “my library” check box in order to secure the title within their database.***

***After the Zoom call, Ann suggested that our next week’s step would be choosing a topic we may use to thematically frame or center our products. There’s a slight trade-off between granularity and relevance, as broader topics have more results and greater breadth of subject than the finer topics. I have yet to choose my topic, but many possibilities are bouncing in my mind. Next week’s log should have my decisions fixed, which is exciting.***

***This week, I have been at times nervous, relaxed, left in silence, and overwhelmed with knowledge. As my progress plan stabilizes over the next few weeks, there will be less excitement but clearer vision and a greater sense of accomplishment. I can feel that good things are coming, and this GitHub page will continue to develop alongside my knowledge and experience in digital curation.***
